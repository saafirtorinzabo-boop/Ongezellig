Created as antithesis of Maya
Creator had obsession with Dutch history of South Africa
Name "Potgieter" taken from real South African the creator knew


COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS (Addressed by Studio Massa)
❌ "Coco's parents were murdered" - Initially believed by fans to be farm attacks, but Studio Massa confirmed it was a lightning strike accident
❌ "Coco is stupid" - She's not stupid, just computer illiterate and "skipped puberty" (forced to act like an adult at a young age)
❌ "'Poes' is cute South African slang" - Actually an obscene Afrikaans word for female genitalia (vulva), equivalent to English "pussy/cunt"

FANON/HEADCANONS (Reddit & Fandom Wikis - NOT CANON)
Popular Fan Theories:
"Dumb Blonde Facade Theory":

Some fans believe Coco hides her intelligence behind a naïve persona
Theory suggests she's actually smarter than she appears but uses facade to hide inner struggles
May have "actually went through puberty" but hides it

Trauma & Therapy:

Fans speculate she goes to therapy for her problems
PTSD from losing entire family at age 6
Theory that she was in orphanage before adoption
Subconscious regrets about unborn sibling explain excessive affection toward adoptive sisters

"Self-Reflection on Biological Family":

Her care for Maya and Mymy is essentially projecting feelings about lost biological relatives
Treats Maya like the little sister she lost

Hidden Depth:

Some fans think she's "mocked for her hidden problems" despite popularity
May be favorite of Maya's parents, making Maya jealous

MBTI Typing:

Commonly typed as ESFJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging)

PLANNED BUT UNPRODUCED EPISODES (Studio Massa's Notes)

Stalks and gaslights the bully until they go insane

Mymy's sister Eiko (disguised as Korean exchange student) manipulates Maya
Coco would have "beaten and kicked" Eiko after discovering the truth
Shows Coco's fierce protectiveness

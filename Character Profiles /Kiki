CANON INFORMATION
From Official Spoiler Document:

"Somali pirate-to-be"

From Series (Deel 3 Dialogue, translated from Dutch):
"...and we're collecting money for children in Somalia so that they can go to pirate school and become pirates and capture oil tankers to finance their drug wars; and when I have my degree I'm moving to Somalia for an internship with a local pirate and I already bought an AK-47 off the darkweb but forgot to order the bullets, so if you know someone you know where to find me."
Visual Design:

Long black hair
Striped black and white shirt (French Breton stripe/marinière - classic French sailor/mime aesthetic)
Red scarf tied over forehead (French stereotype)
Pirate accessories (hoop earrings, cutlass prop)
Bike decorated as pirate ship
Pirate Club flyer on school notice board (filled with "ARRRRR" instead of contact info)

Origin:
French (based on visual design stereotypes and name - "Kiki" is French)
Behavioral Patterns (Canon from series appearances):

Perpetual frowner - never shown smiling except when:

Dreaming (possibly fantasizing about pirate life)
Playing on playground equipment pretending to pilot a ship


Sleeps frequently in class
Delinquent behavior from re-enacting pirate actions (stealing, rule-breaking, etc.)
One of teachers' least favorite students

Relationship with Mymy (Canon):
Used to be friends, now frenemies. Their obsessions conflict:

Mymy: Dutch VOC colonialism worship
Kiki: Pirate anti-colonialism
Get into ideological arguments/LARPs together
Still "hang out" but their established friendship broke down


WHAT THIS TELLS US:
Kiki is a French girl obsessed with Somali piracy who has taken concrete steps toward her goal (buying weapons, researching pirate schools, planning Somalia move after graduation). She's genuinely committed - this isn't casual roleplay.
Her friendship with Mymy dissolved because their obsessions are ideologically incompatible. VOC merchants vs. the pirates who attacked them. But they still interact through their shared LARP intensity - both are teenagers with extreme historical/cultural fixations.
She's a delinquent specifically because she's method-acting pirate behavior. Her rule-breaking isn't random teenage rebellion - it's ideological commitment to the pirate lifestyle (pirates don't follow laws).

HOW SHE FITS ONGEZELLIG'S TONE:
Massa uses extreme commitment to absurd goals. Kiki wants to become a Somali pirate through legitimate career planning (internship, training, weapons procurement). The gap between her teenage reality and criminal aspirations is the comedy.
French girl obsessed with Somali pirates = cultural displacement humor. She's geographically and culturally removed from her obsession but committed anyway.
The deadpan delivery of extreme content ("bought AK-47, forgot bullets") is classic Massa dark humor. Physical comedy through pirate aesthetic (ship-bike, playground "piloting").
She represents the LARP culture taken to dangerous extremes - Mymy wants political power through nationalism, Kiki wants criminal career through piracy.

RELATIONSHIPS:
With Mymy: Used to be friends until their obsessions made it impossible. VOC vs Pirates = ideological warfare. Still hang out and LARP together but as competitive frenemies rather than allies. Both understand each other's intensity even as they oppose each other.
With Teachers: Least favorite student. Constant detention for delinquent behavior. She doesn't care - pirates are outlaws anyway.
With Maya: No established relationship beyond being classmates.

COMEDY POTENTIAL:

French mime/sailor aesthetic applied to Somali piracy
Absurd planning (pirate internship, darkweb weapons shopping)
Forgot bullets (shows she's serious but incompetent)
Perpetual frown except when dreaming of piracy
Playground ship-piloting (physical comedy)
Ideological debates with Mymy taken to LARP extremes


TL;DR:
French girl obsessed with becoming Somali pirate. Wears stereotypical French striped shirt and red scarf. Used to be friends with Mymy until their obsessions (VOC colonialism vs piracy) made them frenemies. Re-enacts pirate behavior through delinquency. Never smiles except when dreaming about pirate life or pretending playground equipment is a ship. Bought AK-47 from darkweb, forgot bullets. Plans genuine move to Somalia for pirate internship after graduation. Teachers hate her. Runs Pirate Club at school with zero members except herself.

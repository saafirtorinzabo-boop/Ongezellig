CHARACTER CONTEXT
The Core Joke:
"Only goth on the Leeward islands" - She's a goth girl from a tropical Caribbean island where goth subculture doesn't exist. Brought Northern European darkness to sunny Curaçao. Cultural displacement.
The Music:
The band's "eurobeat folk" genre is genuinely bad - it's an experimental mess that doesn't work. Coco knows this but supports Cleo anyway because they're friends. This fits Ongezellig's tone: well-meaning teenage attempts at art that fall flat, but friendship persists anyway.
Family Situation:
Mother doesn't support Cleo's music career ambitions. Wants her to focus on practical studies, not "noise." Typical immigrant parent pragmatism vs. teenage artistic dreams. Cleo practices at Coco's house partly to avoid conflict at home.
Social Circle:

Coco: Best friend, drummer in band, unfailingly supportive
Yfke: Band member, constantly stoned, unreliable
Zoey: Band member, quiet but competent
Other classmates: Acquainted but not close


CHARACTERIZATION FOR WRITING
Personality Core:
Cleo is serious about music in a way that doesn't match her actual talent. She wants to be a professional musician - lead singer, touring, the whole dream - but the band is objectively not good. She doesn't realize this. The eurobeat folk genre was probably her idea, trying to create something "no one's done before" without considering whether it should be done.
Key Traits:

Ambitious but misguided - Has big dreams, limited ability to execute
Takes herself seriously - Treats band like professional operation when it's a high school hobby
Protective of the music - Defensive when criticized, doesn't take feedback well
Loyal - Sticks with band despite Yfke's unreliability and Zoey's silence
Goth aesthetic as identity - Uses appearance to stand out, feel unique
Doesn't read the room - Pushes band practice when others aren't invested

The Contradiction:
She's the most serious member of a band that makes terrible music. She's the lead creative force behind something that doesn't work. She's ambitious about a project that will never succeed. This is darkly funny in Ongezellig's style - teenage conviction meeting reality.

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS
With Coco:
Genuine friendship. Coco is the steady one - shows up on time, practices diligently, never complains. Coco knows the music is bad but won't say it because she's loyal and kind. Cleo appreciates Coco's reliability without realizing Coco's just being a good friend, not a fellow true believer.
With Yfke:
Constant frustration. Yfke shows up late, spaces out during practice, forgets parts. Cleo takes this personally - sees it as disrespect to the music. Doesn't understand Yfke's just too high to care. The tension is one-sided; Yfke doesn't notice Cleo's annoyed.
With Zoey:
Functional. Zoey shows up, plays bass competently, doesn't cause problems. Cleo respects this. Zoey never comments on the music quality, which Cleo interprets as approval. Actually Zoey just doesn't care enough to critique.
With Maya:
No real relationship. Maya overhears their practice through walls and hates it. Cleo doesn't know Maya exists. If they interacted, Cleo would be baffled by Maya's inability to have a basic conversation.

WRITING TIPS
Speech Patterns:
Since Cleo doesn't speak in the series, base her voice on Ongezellig's tone: direct, sparse, no excessive emotion.

Short sentences when discussing non-music topics
Longer, more passionate sentences about music/band
Doesn't explain herself much
Assumes others understand her vision
Gets clipped when frustrated

Example dialogue:
"We're practicing Saturday. Three o'clock."
"No, we need to run through it again. It's not tight enough."
"Yfke, you're off tempo. Again."
"This section needs more energy. We're losing the audience."
Physical Mannerisms:

Checks guitar tuning constantly (procrastination/nervousness)
Taps foot when annoyed
Crosses arms when defending music choices
Adjusts hat when uncomfortable
Direct eye contact when serious

Behavioral Notes:

Takes charge of practice schedules
Writes setlists and arrangements
First to arrive, last to leave
Treats school music room like professional studio
Gets quietly frustrated but doesn't blow up
Expects others to match her commitment

How She Fits Scenes:
In band practice:
She's the leader by default. Directs others, counts them in, stops mid-song to correct mistakes. Takes it seriously while everyone else is just hanging out.
In class:
Background presence. Sits in back, doesn't participate much. Doodles lyrics or guitar tabs in notebook margins. Wears headphones when allowed.
In social situations:
Not outgoing like Coco. Has friends through the band but doesn't socialize widely. Goth aesthetic creates distance from mainstream classmates.

COMEDY POTENTIAL
The Gap:
She's intensely serious about music that's genuinely terrible. This is the joke. She talks about "building a fanbase" and "festival bookings" while they can barely get through one song without Yfke forgetting her part.
Coco's Loyalty:
Coco is too nice to tell Cleo the truth. When Cleo asks "What did you think of that run-through?" Coco says "It was good!" with her trademark smile. Cleo believes her. The audience knows Coco's just being kind.
Maya's Perspective:
Maya describes their late-night practice as "a five hour long live podcast by the most uninteresting presenters." This is funny because Cleo thinks they're having deep artistic discussions. Maya's jealous bitterness accidentally reveals the truth.
The Eurobeat Folk Genre:
The genre itself is absurd. Eurobeat (high-energy electronic dance) + folk (acoustic traditional) = sonic disaster. Cleo thought she was being innovative. She created a mess.

THEMATIC FIT
Cleo represents teenage artistic ambition meeting reality. She's displaced (Caribbean goth in Netherlands) and uses music to create identity. She's serious about something she's not good at. She has a friend (Coco) who supports her anyway.
This fits Ongezellig's themes:

Cultural misfits trying to belong
Teenagers convinced of their own importance
Well-meaning failure
Friendship persisting despite obvious problems
The gap between self-perception and reality

She's a minor character who reinforces the main trio's struggles through parallel: Maya wants friends but can't make them, Cleo has a band but can't make good music. Both are failing at what they want most.

TL;DR:
Goth girl from Curaçao who leads a terrible eurobeat folk band. Takes music way too seriously, doesn't realize it's bad. Best friends with Coco, who knows the truth but is too loyal to say anything. Ambitious, serious, defensive about her art. Frustrated by Yfke's drug use, appreciates Zoey's quiet competence. Mother doesn't support music dreams.

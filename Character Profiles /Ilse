CANON INFORMATION
From Official Spoiler Document:

"not Anne Frank"

This is the ONLY canon descriptor for Ilse. This single line is doing ALL the work.

WHAT "NOT ANNE FRANK" ACTUALLY MEANS
The Reference:
Ilse is named after Ilse Wagner - Anne Frank's real classmate who died at Sobibor concentration camp (April 2, 1943, age 14). Anne mentioned her in the diary.
The Dark Joke:
She's a modern Jewish Dutch girl living peacefully in Netherlands. She gets to:

Keep a diary about normal teenage problems
Go to school without hiding
Have friends and create comics
Live a boring, mundane, safe teenage life
Not die in genocide

The Comedy:
Same name, same diary tradition, completely different stakes. Anne Frank documented hiding from death. Ilse documents... comics with Roos, school drama, normal teenage bullshit.
The Theme:
Modern Dutch teenagers have it absurdly easy compared to their grandparents' generation. The arbitrary luck of being born 80 years later. She gets the life Anne Frank and Ilse Wagner were denied.

WHAT THIS REQUIRES (CANONICAL IMPLICATIONS)
For the "not Anne Frank" joke to work, Ilse must be:

Jewish (otherwise the joke makes no sense)
Dutch (in North Brabant with classmates)
Teenager (~14-15, same age Anne Frank was)
Keeps a diary (Anne Frank parallel - this is the core visual gag)
Living normal life (school, friends, zero persecution)

That's it. That's what Massa's joke requires.

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
The joke doesn't specify appearance. Based on name and Jewish identity:

Likely dark hair
Average build, teenager
Dresses practically
Always carrying notebook/diary (this is the key visual - the Anne Frank parallel)


THE DIARY
What Makes It Funny:
Anne Frank's diary = historical testimony of genocide, hiding, fear, loss of innocence, eventually death
Ilse's diary = "Roos and I worked on our comic today," "I got a B+ on my essay," "I think I said something awkward at lunch"
The Contrast:

Anne: "The Gestapo could find us any day"
Ilse: "Do you think Roos liked my dialogue for the pirate character?"

The Weight:
Ilse probably IS aware of this. Dutch schools teach Holocaust extensively. She's visited Anne Frank House. She knows her namesake died. The joke is that she gets to write about boring teenage shit anyway.

PERSONALITY (MINIMAL INFERENCE)
Based purely on "not Anne Frank":
What We Can Reasonably Assume:

Keeps diary (Anne Frank parallel)
Probably introspective/thoughtful (diary-keepers tend to be)
Aware of Holocaust history (it's taught in Dutch schools)
Living normal teenage life (school, friends, hobbies)

What's Massa's Style:

Uses cultural stereotypes as shorthand
But keeps character descriptions minimal
The joke IS the character

Jewish in Dutch School:

Cultural outsider like other Ongezellig characters
But accepted and safe (unlike her historical counterpart)
No persecution, just normal teenage social dynamics


RELATIONSHIP WITH ROOS (CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP)
This appears to be established in supporting materials (the user mentioned MymysFriends.txt confirming Roos/Ilse creative partnership).
How This Fits "Not Anne Frank":
Anne Frank wanted to be a writer and journalist. She dreamed of publishing her diary after the war. She died at 15.
Ilse gets to:

Actually pursue creative writing
Collaborate with artist friend (Roos)
Make silly comics about adventures
Have normal creative teenage friendship
Maybe actually publish something someday

The Partnership:

Ilse writes, Roos draws
Create comics together
Normal teenage creative collaboration
Gets to live the creative life Anne Frank dreamed of


THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
Why "Not Anne Frank" Is Perfect Massa Humor:

Dark Comedy: Same name, same diary habit, utterly different circumstances
Historical Weight: Honors Ilse Wagner by giving modern Ilse the peaceful life Wagner was denied
Generational Luck: Born 80 years later = completely different existence
Minimalist: One line establishes Jewish identity, historical awareness, and current safety
Cultural Representation: Jewish presence in modern Netherlands without trauma

What Massa Is Saying:
Modern teenagers don't appreciate how lucky they are. Their biggest problems are homework and comic collaborations. Their grandparents' generation faced genocide. The joke is the mundane normalcy.

HOW SHE FITS ONGEZELLIG'S TONE
Other Cultural Outsiders:

Mymy: Japanese pretending to be Dutch
Coco: South African orphan
Kiki: French pirate wannabe
Ilse: Jewish diarist living the peaceful life her namesake never got

The Pattern:
Everyone's displaced or carrying cultural weight. But they get to be teenagers about it. Mymy can LARP Dutch nationalism. Coco can play rugby. Kiki can pretend to be a pirate. Ilse can write silly comics with Roos.
The Privilege:
They all live in peaceful, boring, safe Netherlands. No war, no genocide, no persecution. Just school drama and teenage bullshit.

WRITING TIPS
Core Character:

Keeps diary constantly
Aware of historical weight but lives normal life anyway
Jewish cultural identity without defining her entire personality
Creative partnership with Roos (writing/art collaboration)
Background character who represents dark historical joke

The Diary:

Always has it
Writes observations about daily life
Probably reflects on being "not Anne Frank" sometimes
Documents comic collaboration with Roos
Normal teenage concerns, no life-or-death stakes

Jewish Identity:

Present but not overwhelming
She's aware of Holocaust history (how could she not be, with her name?)
But she gets to be a teenager first
Cultural outsider who found acceptance
The joke is the normalcy, not the trauma

Relationship with Roos:

Best friend and creative partner
They make comics together
Ilse writes storylines and dialogue
Normal teenage creative friendship
This is what Anne Frank never got to have

Voice:

Thoughtful (diary keeper)
Probably reads a lot
Creative writer
Normal teenage concerns
NOT defined by constant anxiety or Jewish stereotypes unless it serves the "not Anne Frank" joke


WHAT TO AVOID
Don't overload her with Jewish stereotypes that aren't necessary for the "not Anne Frank" joke:

Massa's joke is minimalist - one line
The joke is about generational luck and mundane normalcy
She doesn't need to be constantly neurotic or spouting Yiddish
She doesn't need to be the "intellectual" or "anxious" stereotype
She just needs to be: Jewish, Dutch, teenager, keeps diary, lives normal life

The joke works BECAUSE she's ordinary. She gets to be boring. That's the entire point.

TL;DR:
Ilse is "not Anne Frank" - Massa's entire character description. Named after Anne Frank's classmate Ilse Wagner who died in Holocaust. She's a modern Jewish Dutch teenager who keeps a diary, but instead of documenting genocide, she documents normal teenage life (comics collaboration with Roos, school stuff, boring teenager concerns). The dark joke: same name, same diary tradition, utterly different circumstances. She gets the peaceful, mundane, creative teenage life that Anne Frank and Ilse Wagner were denied. Keeps diary constantly (visual Anne Frank parallel), works with Roos on comics (writer/artist duo), Jewish cultural identity present but not defining. The comedy is the normalcy - she gets to be bored instead of terrified. That's what "not Anne Frank" means: arbitrary generational luck, 80 years makes all the difference, modern Dutch teenagers have it absurdly easy, she gets to waste her diary on teenage bullshit instead of historical testimony.

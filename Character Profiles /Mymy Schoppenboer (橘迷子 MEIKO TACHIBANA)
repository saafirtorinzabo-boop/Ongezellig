Backstory

Ran Away from Japan: Voluntarily fled Japan because she "liked the Netherlands better"

Why She Changed: Red herring - she knows Eiko is looking for her, and her metamorphosis is mainly for disguise, not just Dutch assimilation
Name Change: Changed from "Meiko" (5 letters) to "Mymy" (4 letters) because everyone else has 4-letter names (Lingo Rules - "IJ" counts as 1 character in Dutch)

Misconceptions (Addressed by Studio Massa)
❌ "Mymy is a Nazi" - "What is patriotic about collaborating with the occupier?" (She's Dutch nationalist, not Nazi sympathizer)
❌ "Mymy wears colors of Prinsenvlag" - She wears modern Dutch flag (red on top, not orange)
❌ "Mymy and Kiki are a couple" - Flashback in Part 6 drawn by illustrator who thought it was cute, no romantic intentions
❌ "Mymy changed appearance to look Dutch" - Mainly for disguise from sister Eiko, not just assimilation
❌ "Mymy is Indonesian" - She's Japanese from Nagasaki

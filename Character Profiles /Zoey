CANON INFORMATION
From Official Spoiler Document:

"Not shy, just introverted"

Key Distinction:

Not Shy: Doesn't have social anxiety or fear of interaction
Just Introverted: Prefers solitude, recharges energy by being alone, chooses quiet over loud

From Mayamail (Semi-Canon):

Doesn't initiate greetings (stood in silence during Maya hallway encounter)
Talks very little ("talks at least as little as I do" per Maya)
Stays overnight at friends' houses (comfortable with band for sleepovers)
Participates in long conversations when comfortable (five-hour late-night band conversation)

From Studio Massa (Canon):

The book she's reading during the series is a romance novel


PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
Hair: Dark brown, shoulder-length, slightly messy
Eyes: Dark brown
Build: Short/petite - shortest member of the band (approximately 5'2")
Skin: Fair/light complexion
Notable Accessory: Always wears a scarf (acts as comfort item and personal "armor")
Clothing Style:

Pink/purple striped shirt (casual, comfortable)
Practical, cozy clothing
Dresses for comfort over fashion

Presence: Very easy to miss in crowd scenes; naturally fades into background

INTERESTS & ACTIVITIES
Reading - Romance Novels (Canon):
Massa confirmed she reads romance books during the series. This reveals:

Quiet girl surrounded by death (funeral home) escapes into stories about love and connection
Contrast between her solemn daily reality and romantic fantasy
Like Maya's anime escapism but healthier - still engaging with human emotion/relationships
Possibly reads romance because she's too introverted to pursue it herself
Lives vicariously through fictional relationships

Likely Reading List:

Contemporary romance
Maybe historical romance (fits her thoughtful nature)
Character-driven love stories
Probably prefers slow-burn romances over explicit content
Spanish romance authors if bilingual (María Dueñas, etc.)

What This Means:

She's a romantic despite her reserved exterior
Understands love/connection intellectually even if she struggles with it practically
The funeral home girl reading about life and love = poetic irony
Quiet observer who understands human emotion deeply

Music - "Running in the 60's" Band:

Role: Bass guitarist
Genre: Eurobeat folk
Band Members: Cleo (vocals/guitar), Coco (drums), Yfke (synthesizer), Zoey (bass)


FAMILY BACKGROUND
Funeral Home Heritage:
Born into family running generational funeral home business. Raised surrounded by silence, solemnity, and death from young age. Parents taught her to approach life and death with respect and calm professionalism.
Impact on Character:

Comfort with silence stems from funeral home atmosphere
Respectful, measured approach to interactions
Not disturbed by dark or morbid topics
Understanding of grief, loss, and human fragility
Mature beyond her years
Reads romance as escape from constant death - needs stories about life, love, beginnings instead of endings

Spanish Heritage:
Family immigrated from Spain to Netherlands. Funeral home might incorporate Spanish death rituals/customs. Bilingual (Spanish at home, Dutch at school). Reads Spanish literature and romance novels in original language.
Why This Matters:

Spanish culture has rich relationship with death (Día de los Muertos influence)
Catholic funeral traditions = respect for ritual and ceremony
Another cultural outsider like other Ongezellig characters
Spanish romance novels = connection to heritage


THE ROMANCE BOOK SIGNIFICANCE
The Mortician's Daughter Reading Romance:
Someone who deals with death daily escaping into stories about love and life. The quiet girl who watches relationships form around her (Cleo's band friendships, Coco's popularity) but doesn't participate - instead she reads about fictional ones.
Contrast to Maya:

Maya: Escapes into anime/hentai (sexual fantasy, completely removed from reality)
Zoey: Escapes into romance (emotional connection, still grounded in human relationships)
Maya's escapism is isolating, Zoey's is aspirational
Both are introverts who struggle with connection, but Zoey's outlet is healthier

Why She Doesn't Pursue Romance Herself:

Too introverted to initiate
Comfortable observing rather than participating
Funeral home background = understands everything ends, maybe hesitant to begin
Has friends (band) so emotional needs partially met
Content with vicarious experience through books

Band Might Not Know:

Probably hides romance novel covers (embarrassed?)
Friends think she reads "literature"
Actually reading bodice-rippers and slow-burn love stories
This would be her secret - the quiet girl has romantic side


RELATIONSHIPS
With Maya (from Mayamail):
The Hallway Encounter:

Direct eye contact in hallway
Both stood in silence - Maya waiting for Zoey to greet first
Zoey said nothing, walked back into Coco's room
Maya's reaction: "rude bitch"

Maya's Jealousy:

"She talks at least as little as I do, but somehow has friends and is in a band?"
Maya sees Zoey as proof that being quiet isn't the problem
Zoey has everything Maya wants despite similar personality

The Sleepover:

Band stayed overnight at Schoppenboer house
Zoey participated in long late-night conversations
Maya forced to listen through walls, bitter and jealous
"If I had a band it'd be so much more fun..."

With Cleo:

Closest friendship in band
Both serious about music
Comfortable silence between them
Mutual respect for talent
Might share books (if Cleo knew about romance novels)

With Yfke:

Patient tolerance of drug use
Height difference = physical comedy (6'0" vs 5'2")
Quiet caretaking when Yfke is too high

With Coco:

Appreciates Coco's inclusion
Coco talks, Zoey listens
Functional dynamic

With Band Overall:

Close enough for sleepovers
Participates in conversations when comfortable
Small circle of close friends, doesn't need more


CHARACTER QUIRKS
Height (5'2" - Shortest):

10-inch difference with Yfke (comedic visual)
Has to look up at everyone
Uses step stool to reach things
Friends tease gently, she responds deadpan

The Scarf:

Always wears it regardless of weather
Personal "armor" against world
Possibly Spanish-style scarf (cultural connection)
Fidgets with it when uncomfortable (rare)
Security item that's socially acceptable

Sense of Humor:

Dry, deadpan delivery
Self-deprecating about height
Appreciates absurdist humor
Doesn't laugh loudly but smiles quietly


THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
The Healthy Introvert vs. Maya:
Both are extremely quiet and struggle with initiating conversation, but:

Zoey: Accepted herself → has friends, reads romance, participates in band
Maya: Hates herself → isolated, watches hentai, only imaginary friends

Zoey represents what Maya could have been - an introvert who found compatible friend group and healthy escapism (romance novels about human connection vs. hentai about sexual fantasy).
Death and Romance:
Funeral home girl reading romance novels = someone surrounded by endings who craves stories about beginnings. She understands mortality deeply, which might make love seem both precious and frightening. She observes rather than participates - safer to read about it.
Cultural Integration:
Spanish girl in Dutch school who found acceptance through music. Maintains heritage (Spanish language, possibly Spanish funeral customs) while integrating successfully. Contrast to Mymy (rejects Japanese heritage) and Maya (can't integrate at all).

WRITING TIPS
Voice/Speech Patterns:

Minimal dialogue
Short, direct responses
Doesn't fill silence with chatter
Thoughtful word choice when she does speak

Physical Mannerisms:

Often reading (romance novels she tries to hide)
Adjusts scarf when uncomfortable
Deadpan expression most of the time
Small, economical movements

Behavioral Notes:

Brings book everywhere (current romance novel)
Participates in band practice seriously
Comfortable in small group settings (band sleepovers)
Avoids large social gatherings
Recharges alone with books

Romance Book Detail:

Might be embarrassed if band discovered what she reads
Keeps covers hidden or uses book sleeve
Escapes into fictional relationships during lunch
Understands love intellectually from books, not experience


TL;DR:
Zoey is the shortest band member (5'2"), with dark brown hair and eyes, always wearing a scarf as personal armor. She's "not shy, just introverted" - comfortable with small friend group but recharges alone. Raised in Spanish funeral home family, surrounded by death and solemnity, she escapes into romance novels (confirmed by Massa). This creates poetic contrast: the quiet mortician's daughter reading about love and life. Has everything Maya wants (friends, band, belonging) despite similar introverted personality. Participated in five-hour late-night conversation that made Maya jealous. Closest to Cleo in band, tolerates Yfke's chaos, appreciates Coco's inclusion. Represents healthy introversion - accepted herself, found compatible friends, uses fiction as inspiration not isolation. The hallway encounter with Maya (both stood in silence, Zoey walked away unbothered while Maya spiraled) shows how similar personalities can have completely different outcomes.

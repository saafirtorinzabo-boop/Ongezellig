Maya always rejects or runs from these attempts
Coco recognizes Maya's loneliness and wants to help

Feels jealous of Coco's popularity and beauty (fanon but implied)

With Mymy (Adoptive Sister):

Mymy oblivious to Maya's struggles

Key Character Inspirations
Tomoko Kuroki (Watamote):

Obvious direct inspiration
Female NEET with social anxiety
Anime/otaku obsession
Inability to make friends
Lives in fantasy world
Unlike Tomoko, Maya has somewhat worse family situation

Weezer's "Pinkerton" Album:

Phone wallpaper choice is VERY deliberate
Album themes: loneliness, failed relationships, isolation, depression, desperate need for connection
Songs like "Tired of Sex," "Why Bother?," and "Butterfly" all fit Maya's character

Symbolic Details
Mixed Heritage Map:

Indonesia overlay on Europe map behind her seat
Represents inability to belong anywhere
Neither fully Dutch nor Indonesian nor Indian nor Chinese
Doesn't fit into any cultural box

Red Color Palette:

Always wears red
Could symbolize anger, passion, or blood
Consistent across all official depictions
Her "brand" color

Messy vs. Bun Hair:

Bun at school = attempt to fit in, present normal appearance
Loose/messy at home = true self, giving up
When daydreaming = loose hair (escaping into fantasy)

Real goal: kidnap Mymy back to Japan
Coco would discover truth and beat/kick Eiko

FANON/HEADCANONS (Reddit & Fandom - NOT CANON)
Psychological Theories:
"Trauma/Bullying Origin":

Fans believe Maya suffered significant trauma or bullying in past
This caused her to develop anxiety and withdraw
Possibly why she can't connect with anyone now

"Anke is Real Too":

Since Epke was proven real in comics, fans theorize Anke might be real person too
Maya may have hallucinated/fantasized both after failed social interactions

"Bisexual/Hypersexual":

Watches both male/female hentai
Fantasy about Mymy "colonizing virgin islands" (lesbian incest fantasy)
Also showed interest in Epke (male)
Possibly bisexual or just extremely horny teenager with no outlet
Has "various strange fetishes or sexual desires" (tentacles confirmed)

"Low Self-Esteem Spiral":

Fears what people think of her constantly
Even imaginary friend Anke calls her "cringe"
Internalizes all criticism
Can't accept compliments or friendship attempts

"Jealous of Coco":

Coco is beautiful, popular, athletic, kind
Everything Maya isn't
Creates resentment despite Coco's genuine care
"It's better to have no friends than no parents" comment came from this jealousy

MBTI Typing:

Commonly typed as INFP or INTP
Introverted, anxious, lives in head
Enneagram 5w4 or 4w5 (The Investigator/Individualist)

Other Headcanons:
"Cat Person":

Fans think she'd love cats
Would relate to them (independent, aloof, misunderstood)

"Huge Weeb":

Beyond just hentai, probably watches tons of anime
Has extensive anime knowledge
Mymy's hatred of anime creates friction

"Virgin Islands" Sexual Fantasy:

The Mymy "colonize her virgin islands" line spawned tons of fanon
Implies Maya may have incestuous attraction to Mymy
Or just desperate for any intimacy, even inappropriate
Could be messed up coping mechanism

"Actually Smart":

Some fans think she's intelligent but can't show it due to anxiety
Her presentation paralysis isn't stupidity - it's fear

WRITING TIPS FOR MAYA
Voice/Speech Patterns:

Quiet, stammering, hesitant
Trails off mid-sentence
Avoids eye contact (describe in narration)
Short, clipped responses
Internal monologue is WAY more active than external speech

Desperate for connection but terrified of it
Lives entirely in fantasy/online world
Cannot distinguish reality from delusion anymore
Deeply lonely but pushes everyone away
Self-destructive tendencies (vomiting to avoid school, suicide ideation)
Hypersexual but no healthy outlet (hentai addiction)

Conflict Points:

Any social interaction = panic trigger
Being perceived/looked at = anxiety spike
Questions about friends = breakdown
Expectations from others = paralysis
Real connection offers = flight response

Relationship Dynamics:
With Coco:

Wants to accept help but can't
Jealous of her but also grateful
Guilty for rejecting her efforts
Knows Coco cares but feels unworthy

With Mymy:

Complicated (possibly sexual) feelings
Hates that Mymy hates anime
Feels inferior to Mymy's confidence
Simultaneously attracted to and intimidated by her

With Parents:

Father: Absent, barely interacts
Mother: Hostile, seems to dislike Maya
No real family bond
Eats dinner in silence

With Classmates:

Bullied constantly
Called loser, weirdo, autistic
Has no allies or friends
Avoids everyone

Comedy Style:

Dark humor (suicide jokes, social failure)
Cringe comedy (awkward situations)
Dramatic irony (audience knows she's delusional)
Self-deprecating internal monologue

Behavioral Notes:

Wears same red hoodie constantly (comfort item)
Hair in bun at school (trying to look normal), messy at home (gave up)
Always on computer when alone
Takes sleeping meds (Zolpidem) which worsen hallucinations
Plays Sims to simulate social life she can't have
Watches hentai as only sexual outlet
Physically runs from social situations
Creates literal barriers (tape) to keep people out
Can't complete basic tasks (presentations) due to anxiety paralysis

Tragedy Elements:

Every attempt at connection fails
Gets worse over series, not better
Final scene: Rejects sisters' invitation, chooses isolation
Stuck in cycle of loneliness feeding more loneliness
Mixed heritage means she belongs nowhere
Even imaginary friends think she's cringe
Mother hates her for unknown reasons
Will likely never recover or improve


FINAL NOTE FROM STUDIO MASSA:
Maya's character is meant to show a downward spiral with no happy ending in sight. The series ends with her choosing isolation over connection, rejecting her sisters' final attempt to include her. She represents someone who has retreated so far into fantasy that she can no longer engage with reality. Her schizophrenic delusions (imaginary friends) and inability to distinguish real people (Epke) from hallucinations suggest she's experiencing a complete break from reality by age 16.
The "Maya's Sweet 16" comic showing her forcing herself to vomit and crying alone is the darkest official Ongezellig content, which is why Massa regrets releasing it - it doesn't fit the "comedy" tone of the main series but reveals the true depths of Maya's suffering.

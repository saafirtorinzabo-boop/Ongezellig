ORIGIN & BACKGROUND
From Friesland:
Yfke is from Friesland (Fryslân), the northern province of Netherlands. Ongezellig takes place in Randstad (the urban western region). This creates cultural displacement:
Friesland vs. Randstad:

Friesland = rural, agricultural, distinct culture and language (Frisian/Frysk)
Randstad = urban, cosmopolitan (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague region)
Yfke moved from countryside to city
Another cultural outsider like other Ongezellig characters

Why This Matters:

Frisian identity is strong - they have their own language, flag, anthem
Moving to Randstad = culture shock (rural to urban)
Hippie aesthetic might be rebellion against or nostalgia for rural roots
Drug use possibly started as coping mechanism for displacement
Loves Friesland, misses home
Might speak Frisian when very high (reverts to native language)

Frisian Stereotypes:

Stubborn, independent
Proud of regional identity
Rural/farming background
Close to nature (fits hippie aesthetic)
Slower pace of life (fits her mellow personality)


INTERESTS & ACTIVITIES
Music - "Running in the 60's" Band:

Role: Synthesizer/keyboard player
Genre: Eurobeat folk
Band members: Cleo (vocals/guitar), Coco (drums), Yfke (synthesizer), Zoey (bass)

Synthesizer Choice:

Electronic instrument = can play while high
Less physically demanding
Creates trippy, psychedelic sounds
Sits down to play (perfect for being stoned)

Drug Use:

Marijuana addiction (primary drug)
Smokes in school bathroom constantly
Gets detention frequently
Possibly deals to students (popular fan theory)
Friends with Koos and Goof (fellow stoners)

Hippie Culture:

60s/70s aesthetic obsession
Peace signs everywhere
Anti-establishment vibes
Environmentalism (plants in room)
"Make love not war" mentality

Friesland Nostalgia:

Loves Friesland, misses home
Might talk about countryside when high
References Frisian culture occasionally
Rural roots inform her environmental values


RELATIONSHIPS
With Coco (Best Friend - Canon):
Good friends per official document. Coco doesn't judge, probably doesn't fully understand drug addiction. Yfke appreciates Coco's unconditional kindness. Practices at Coco's house regularly. Might feel guilty for bringing drugs around innocent Coco.
With Cleo (Frustrated Friend - Canon):
Cleo is "annoyed by Yfke usually" per canon sources. Cleo wants Yfke to take band seriously. Yfke's drug use undermines Cleo's ambitions. Professional vs. unprofessional dynamic. But Cleo doesn't abandon her - loyalty wins over frustration.
With Zoey (Quiet Understanding):
Both are quieter members (different reasons - Zoey from introversion, Yfke from being stoned). Height contrast = comedy (6'0" vs 5'2"). Zoey probably finds drug use frustrating but doesn't confront. Minimal interaction but functional cooperation.
With Goof (Good Friend & Weed Partner):
Goof's official descriptor: "only listens to nu-metal"
Close friendship beyond just smoking together:

Both stoners but genuinely like each other
Nu-metal and weed culture overlap
Probably met through drug use, stayed friends for personality
Get detention together constantly
Share music taste discussions (psychedelic hippie vs. aggressive nu-metal = funny contrast)
Goof might be protective of Yfke (tall girl attracts unwanted attention)
Yfke supplies weed, Goof supplies nu-metal recommendations
Both are "high heads" trio with Koos

With Koos (Drug Circle):
Koos's official descriptor: "says yes to MDMA"
Part of the "high heads" trio (Yfke, Goof, Koos):

Koos does harder drugs (MDMA/ecstasy)
Yfke sticks to weed mostly
They hang out to smoke/use together
Get detention as a group
School's biggest substance users
Teachers have given up on all three
Koos might pressure Yfke to try harder drugs occasionally
Yfke too mellow to care about peer pressure

With Teachers (Especially Vera):
One of least favorite students. Constant detention. Probably fails classes from being too high. Teachers can always spot her (she's 6'0" and smells like weed).

At School:

Sneaks to bathroom to smoke every chance
Smells like weed constantly
Falls asleep in class
Forgets locker combination daily
Gets detention, doesn't care (chance to nap)

Leans on things/people for support
Half-lidded eyes permanently
Gentle, uncoordinated gestures

Stares into space, zones out mid-conversation
Slow blinks (processing takes time)


HEIGHT DYNAMICS (6'0" TALLEST)
With Zoey (5'2"):

10-inch difference = visual comedy gold
Has to look WAY down to make eye contact
Zoey uses Yfke to reach high shelves

With Cleo (5'6"-5'7"):

5-6 inch difference
Cleo annoyed when Yfke leans on her
"Get off me, you're too tall and too high"

With Coco (5'9"):

3-inch difference, closest in height
Yfke still noticeably taller
Coco doesn't mind Yfke leaning on her

Comedy Potential:

Tries to sneak to bathroom, towers over everyone
Teachers always spot her immediately
Forgets to duck, hits head on doorframes
Falls asleep standing up, still taller than sitting classmates
Can't hide when high because she's so tall


VOICE & SPEECH PATTERNS

"Like" and "man" filler words constantly
Forgets names: "Oh yeah, that girl... with the... thing..."
Giggles randomly, finds everything funny
Soft, mellow tone, never raises voice

Occasional Frisian words/phrases when very high


THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
Cultural Displacement:
Rural Frisian girl in urban Randstad. Loves home region but stuck in city. Uses drugs to cope with displacement. Hippie aesthetic = nostalgia for countryside peace. Another cultural outsider like Mymy (Japanese), Coco (South African), Kiki (French), etc.
Comedy vs. Tragedy:

Comic relief: absurd stoner situations, height + high combo
Tragic undertone: addiction masking real pain
Friesland backstory adds depth - she's escaping something
Band keeps her minimally functional


COMEDY POTENTIAL
Height + Stoner Combo:

"Nobody saw me, right?" (everyone saw her)
Hits head on doorframe: "When did that get there?"
Teachers: "YFKE, GET BACK HERE" (she's impossible to miss)

Drug-Related:

Brings wrong books to class
Offers weed to teacher by accident
Gets philosophical: "What if synthesizers are just... future electric pianos?"
Forgets she's in band mid-performance

Frisian Identity:

Rambles about Friesland when high
"You know what Friesland has? Cows, man... so many cows..."
Tries to teach band Frisian, they're too confused
"In Fryslân, we would just... chill, you know?"

Contrast With Others:

Mymy (intense) vs. Yfke (too high to care)
Maya (desperate for friends) vs. Yfke (has friends, too stoned to appreciate)
Zoey (healthy introvert) vs. Yfke (chemically-induced calm)


WRITING TIPS
Core Characteristics:

Constantly high (defining trait)
Extremely tall (6'0", physically stands out)
From Friesland, loves home, stuck in Randstad
Hippie aesthetic with rural roots
Laid-back to a fault, unreliable but kind
Good friends with Goof beyond just drugs


Relationship Dynamics:

Koos: Drug circle, harder substances
Maya: Parallel struggles, no direct interaction


TL;DR:
Yfke is the 6'0" blonde hippie stoner from Friesland now living in Randstad (cultural displacement). Her entire personality revolves around being constantly high - "SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY" is her only official descriptor. Plays synthesizer in band, shows up late, spaces out during practice. Good friends with Coco (who doesn't understand addiction), frustrates Cleo (who wants her to take band seriously), has height comedy with Zoey (10-inch difference). Close friends with Goof beyond just smoking together - they genuinely like each other despite music taste contrast (psychedelic hippie vs. nu-metal). Part of "high heads" trio with Goof and Koos. Loves Friesland, misses rural home, uses hippie aesthetic and drugs to cope with urban displacement. Might speak Frisian when very high. Teachers hate her, can always spot her (tallest + smells like weed). Kind-hearted but unreliable. Possibly deals drugs. Has friends despite addiction.

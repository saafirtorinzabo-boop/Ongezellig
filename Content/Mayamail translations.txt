History today was about Anne Frank. I wasn’t very interested but it did give me the idea to start a diary. Writing down "alone and bored" every day gets boring fairly quickly, so maybe a weekly or monthly diary would be a better idea 

Today the class came up with the brilliant idea to draw lots for the klassensurprises. must come up with a way out asap. Pippi longstocking (Mymy) immediately refused because of her "faith" ... can you be jealous of someone's stupidity? 
That's all that happened today... been more than two months since my birthday. Coco acts as if she didn't see anything. luckily, seeing as she wouldn't have understood it anyways. can now never use the bulimia method again.

Almost december... Christmas is mostly just dealing with family so I'll probably be able to survive that, but the 16th falls on a weekend this year so she will probably take advantage of that - better be careful. 
I don't know what else to write, not that it matters anyway.

Today we continued with Anne Frank. What I've learnt: Anne was a beta, not very attractive and completely cut off from the outside world. i thought, hey, this is relatable and i almost sympathized

but then

"oh and she was hitting on the boy she was hiding with"

even Anne Frank had more experience than me... if they start persecuting eurasians, i might still have a chance

Furthermore, I didn't have to worry about drawing lots with the others because they didn't even ask me to participate. I should be happy about that, but i'm not

To distract myself I started thinking about having sex while being in hiding and now I feel even worse. and then i noticed that it's already december and now i just want to hibernate

friday december 7th
Wednesday was Sinterklaas. only pippi longstocking and i did not participate in the class surprises. Pippi STILL believes in Sinterklaas and calls making surprises a sacrilege. When I explain that Sinterklaas is a ruse she calls me a heretic and conspiracy theorist and that they said the same thing about the moon landing.
Coco asked why I didn't participate in the surprises. i said i wasn't invited but apparently there were no invitations and that everyone else has signed up for them... she suggested sharing her surprise with me, but then we would both have 1 drumstick, so i said no.
In the evening we had to stage pakjesavond to make Pippi indulge in her illusions. Mom had asked in advance what kind of gifts I wanted, but all the things I really want are way too embarrassing to let her buy them. so i asked for more kruidnoten so i can ration for the winter. according to my bmi i'm still underweight so it can't be THAT unhealthy. Pippi now thinks that i have only been given kruidnoten because of my heresy and says that cabinet schoppenboer will launch a new crusade to protect the true faith. 
glad it's over, but i still don't know anything about the 16th...
I think it's the calm before the storm.

I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT FOR GOD'S SAKE

I had been anticipating it for days and tonight she (without knocking of course) came into my room (luckily i was just simming this time). i remember roughly what she said:

"so, it's my birthday next Sunday, and I couldn't choose who to invite to my party, so I just invited the whole class. To our home. I already know that everyone is coming, but not if you are yet, even though you live here naturally, but everyone is participating, so, if you would also participate i would really appreciate it"

This is just blackmail and she knows exactly what she is doing.

I thought out three scenarios in my head:

i go
pros: coco is not angry
cons: standing alone in a corner the entire time, fear, humiliation, shame, not knowing what to do and say and bothering everyone with my presence

i don't go
pros: i don't go
cons: coco is veeeeeeeeeery angry and if i stay in my room (where else should i go) i have to hear how much fun everyone is having without that boring girl

i can't go
pros: i don't go and coco is not angry
cons: ???

I have a week to figure out how to stop myself from going. Normally I'd use the bulimia method, but since my birthday she will suspect any of the excuses I use as me trying to get out of it.

unless...

I do something so crazy that no one would ever believe I did it on purpose...

saturday december 15th
after i am done writing i am jumping down the stairs
I don't think they’ll believe that I did it on purpose. I've thought about everything so that the damage will be minimal and the result will be maximum. What I have to pay particular attention to is that my injuries are not too big to go to the emergency room, but big enough that I don't have to go to the party.
First I have to make sure I have a good excuse for why I "fell" down the stairs, so I’ll be wearing shoes with loose laces that I'll "trip over".
Of course, I'm not just going to jump down the stairs and let gravity do the rest! I make a controlled, careful dive so that I absorb the impact with my arms as much as possible. This will protect my head and hopefully give me some convincing scrapes and bruises so they can't suspect me of faking it. I'll try to thump as hard as possible with each step so that it sounds much more serious than it is. Once at the bottom of the stairs I'll make sure they find me in a painful looking position. I certainly shouldn't complain about a headache, so they don't think I have a concussion and call 1-1-2 . It’ll mainly be my arms and legs that "hurt", making it difficult for me to move and me "unfortunately" having to stay in bed all weekend long.
Of course, i can't stay home tomorrow because i can't "rest" during a busy party, so i’ll ask mom to take me to grandma and grandpa's so i can "recover" there. once there i can relax all day with my phone, get unlimited spring rolls and above all NO PARTY :D :D :D
and if i stick around a little longer, i might not even have to go to school next week and i'll have vacation a week early!! i haven't been able to sleep all week because of the panic attacks so i deserved it imo.
It's now or never... ahah so much adrenaline! but i've been preparing for this all week and literally anything is better than going to that party!

Tomorrow I'll write how it went! if i even live to tell the tale, haha

This weekend I learnt that fantasizing about doing crazy things is much easier than actually doing said crazy things.

All week I was coming up with reasons to do it, but once I actually got to it and looked down the flight of stairs, all sorts of reasons to not do it suddenly started appearing in my head. i stood there for at least 5 minutes until i suddenly remembered what i should have thought of much earlier

What would Coco think if I fell down the stairs?

and then i went back to my room

so tonight was spent waiting for Coco to come up and actually invite me. i had no energy left to come up with a plan so i just let it happen

last week i wrote this:

1. i go
pros: coco is not angry
cons: standing alone in a corner all the time, fear, humiliation, shame, not knowing what to do and say and bothering everyone with my presence
2. i don't go
pros: i don't go
cons: coco is veeeeeeeeeery angry and if i stay in my room (where else should i go) i have to hear how much fun everyone is having without that boring girl
3. i can't go
pros: i don't go and coco is not angry
cons: ???

deep down i hoped i was brave enough to go for option 1
it does sound very nice without that boring girl

Christmas Break is the worst break. You finally get some free time, just to be forced to celebrate a stupid party with a stupid family and stupid christmas music. New Year's is even worse, drunk idiots who start making loud noises because the year changes numbers.. So instead of forgetting that you have to go to school, you have to spend half of the holiday stressing about even more nonsensical obligations.
Pippi got in trouble for attacking Santa Claus at the mall. She called him an imperialist spy and shot him in the head while shouting "saint nicholas is great!". it was with a nerf gun so he wasn't hurt of course but it made the child on his lap cry very loudly.
Coco was quite distant this week.
I also found, at last, a personality test that actually suits me. The results are quite depressing so it must be reliable. I saved it so i can check if i’m making progress or if i somehow start doing even worse (Test result added)

hey maya, remember when you thought Christmas Break would start being fun when the once holidays were over?
haha silly maya, if you don't come to school, school will come to you.
SO because school was closed and they couldn't use the music room, i was repeatedly treated to free rehearsals of coco's moronic band. I've always wanted to play an instrument but never did because the walls are too thin here. pippi would laugh at me and coco would try to help me all the time and i don't know which one is worse.
all four band members are in my class, but except for Coco, I never remember their names. They make Eurobeatfolk because the guitarist really wanted to do something that no one has done before without thinking about whether it happens to sound good or not. i'm sure coco also realizes how bad the music is but she only joins in because they are her friends and she collects friends like they're stamps. is a friend still worth anything if you have so many? If I continue to avoid her, I can brag at Christmas this year that I am the only one in the class who managed not to make friends with Coco, which imo is way more impressive than hitting stuff with sticks.
The second worst moment was when I bumped into the bass player while going to the bathroom. I always listen through the walls before I go to see if the coast is clear, but she almost never says anything so I made a wrong guess. I opened my door and BOOM eye contact. Greetings are my achilles' heel so I stood there like an idiot waiting for her to say hi first. she didn't and she just walked back into coco's room. rude bitch. She talks at least as little as I do, but somehow has friends and is in a band? Do I look like I'm from Chernobyl or something?
but the worst part was when they stayed over. I was still awake probably because of the eye contact incident so I had no choice. I would describe the night as being forced to listen to a five hour long live podcast by the most uninteresting presenters on the most unimportant topics. Jesus christ friendship is overrated.
man...
if i had a band it'd be so much more fun...

monday january 28th
uhhhh if things continue like this, these weekly diary entries are gonna turn into yearly diary entries
i should have known that i couldn't keep it up every week. I once tried to learn Japanese, within three days I knew all the hiragana and katakana by heart and I was full of motivation. but then kanji came along and I've never had motivation for it ever since. but i have a test in exactly 6 hours and i had to do something to delay studying so here i am again
nothing has happened since the holidays ended anyway. There was this time when mom said grandpa and grandma are looking for a store assistant and I almost had a heart attack. the fact that I don't have to go outside after school is the only thing that keeps me from cutting or something. And i don't think a cashier girl with the aura of an aborted blobfish is of any use to them
But did she seriously think I was suitable for that job? then she's even less informed than i thought. but i guess your own daughter doesn't really matter anymore if you've bought two substitutes to compensate
not that i have mommy issues or anything, as if i'm waiting for another snooper like coco. As long as they leave me alone I have no reason to cut. anyways i never really understood self-harmers, i tried it once after reading about it but it mostly hurt. maybe i'm just not miserable enough
BUT NOT FOR LONG, because in just over two weeks the third most depressing day of the year will come, right after september 21st and the day school starts again. and yippeeeee it falls on a school day this year. if i start cutting myself everyday from now on, i'll probably have lost enough blood to be able to convincingly skip school haha

FUCK VALENTINE'S DAY
so every february our school holds a ‘Rosesale’ where students can buy roses for each other that are then distributed on valentine
"hahahahha maya is jealous because she doesn't get roses"
you thought so bitch, i get one every year. not from a boy of course, but as a kind of consolation prize from coco because she gets about 10 roses every year and she probably felt sorry for me so she always buys me 1 too. also for pippi btw because otherwise she would get jealous lol
but the comfort rose is not the reason why valentine's day should be aborted from the calendar
yes, i know very well that this """"holiday"""" is just a fabrication by stores to sell nasty perfumes
bbbbuuut theeennn
wwwwwwhhhyyyy
DO I ALWAYS HOPE FOR MORE THAN 1 ROSE GOD DAMN IT
to avoid the inevitable disappointment i try to remind myself WHY i will never get more than 1 rose
and having to remind yourself for weeks
how boring and ugly you are
is so
terribly
tiring
hopefully everything will be back to normal after thursday

valentine's day

Dear diary

i got a second rose today

it's currently torn to pieces in a trash bin somewhere

everything is worse now

i'll explain it to you later

first i have to try something out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ash Wednesday 
well then long story short:
so i got that 2nd rose, i was completely full of adrenaline and all, but then it turned out that coco had bought 1 rose for the entire class because she didn't want to leave anyone out and that 2nd rose also came from her as a kind of double consolation rose. that was a bit of a disappointment sooooo i tore them both apart oops
well it's better to do things like that in your revenge fantasies than in front of the entire class.
Coco would take up cooking for us that evening and I had locked myself in my room. but instead of beating me up or at least starving me she just brought the food upstairs and apologized for ruining MY valentine's day.
That made me feel even more guilty so i decided that if she doesn't want to punish me, I'll do it myself. So I left her food alone that night and went to sleep quite hungry.
The next day was another school day among people who now hate me even more than before, so I skipped breakfast too and didn't bring lunch. The entire day I had too much of a stomach ache to realize that i was maya, so that was already a better day than usual
I only ate again at dinner, but that was only because we sit at the dinner table together and it would be too noticeable, but I felt guilty again when I was full so I also ONLY had dinner all weekend. and i haven’t really wanted to break my streak since so i've been doing this for three weeks straight. I've already went from 44 to 40 kilos, but I always wear baggy clothing so no one will notice..
and no, i am NOT anorexic because that's for THOTS who get insecure when they see the billboards. What I do is called FASTING, because that's what people from Brabant are supposed to do after carnival to atone for their sins (i just needed a head start). and normally carnival makes me feel like vomiting, but that's not possible if you don't have anything to vomit ;p

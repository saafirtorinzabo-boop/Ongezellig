Character Background (Canon from Official Document)
From the classmates section:

"Cleo: only goth on the Leeward islands"

This is the ONLY direct characterization Studio Massa gave for Cleo in the official spoiler document.
Maya's Perspective (from Mayamails - Semi-Canon)
Important Note: Studio Massa stated Mayamails are "not exactly part of the lore" but more experimental content.
From Maya's diary entry (between January 2-5):

Band visits Schoppenboer house to practice since school music room closed
Maya bashes the band for trying "eurobeat folk" (thinks it's stupid idea)
Maya complains about Coco "collecting friends like stamps"
Maya describes band discussions as "hollow"
Maya is jealous, writes: "if I had a band, it would be so much more fun than Coco's"


FANON/HEADCANONS (Fandom Discussions - NOT CANON)
Popular Fan Interpretations:
"Drug Dealer Yfke" Theory:

Some fans headcanon Yfke as school's biggest drug dealer
Since Cleo is close friends with Yfke (who is "constantly stoned"), fans theorize Cleo might partake but isn't as extreme
"Virgin island status" meme applied to Cleo by some fans

Personality Headcanons:

"Edgy but friendly" - Goth aesthetic but actually kind to friends
"Big fan of dark/edgy humor" - Fits goth stereotype
"Annoyed by Yfke sometimes" - Despite friendship, gets frustrated with constant drug use
"Attention-seeking" - Goth appearance + experimental music = wants to be noticed

Background Theories:

Moved from Curaçao to Netherlands at young age (exact timing unknown)
May have experienced culture shock/isolation (only goth in Caribbean)
Goth aesthetic might be rebellion or way to stand out in new country
Music is her escape/passion

MBTI Typing:

Commonly typed as ESFP or ENFP (Extroverted, creative, friendly)

Band Dynamics (Fan Theories):
"Cleo as Leader" Theory:

Lead singer + guitarist = likely band founder or leader
Most extroverted of the group
Holds band together despite members' issues (Yfke's drug use, Zoey's shyness)

"Genre Choice" Theory:

"Eurobeat folk" is deliberately weird experimental choice
Might be Cleo's idea to stand out from other school bands
Maya thinks it's stupid, but fans wonder if it actually works

IMPORTANT NOTES
Why Cleo Has Limited Canon Info:

Background character with minimal screen time
Official spoiler document only gives one line: "only goth on the Leeward islands"
Most characterization comes from:

Visual design (goth aesthetic, Ç necklace)

What We DON'T Know (Canon):

Why she moved from Curaçao to Netherlands
When she met Coco and became friends
Her family situation
How the band formed
Her academic performance
Her relationship with other classmates besides band members
Voice/voice actor (no speaking lines in series)
Exact personality beyond visual/behavioral clues


WRITING TIPS FOR CLEO
Core Personality - "Marceline Type" (Adventure Time Reference)
The Wall-Builder:

Naturally puts up walls - defense mechanism, not cruelty
Hard to become friends with - tests people before letting them in
Loyal once you're in - ride-or-die for her inner circle
Comes across as "bitch" or "aggressive" on first impression
Actually protective and caring - just doesn't show it easily
Trust issues - being "only goth on Leeward islands" = felt like outsider

First Impression vs. Reality:

First Meeting (Non-Music):

Short responses, dismissive body language
Eye rolls, crossed arms, skeptical looks
"Why are you talking to me?"
Seems unapproachable, intimidating
People think she's mean or stuck-up


First Meeting (Music-Related):

Seems like she's testing your knowledge (she's NOT, just passionate)
Intense questions about favorite bands, instruments, genres
Comes across as gatekeeping or interrogating
Actually just excited to find someone who shares interest
People think she's being elitist when she's genuinely curious


After Breaking Through Walls:

Warm, protective, funny
Shares music recommendations enthusiastically
Remembers details about friends
Fiercely defends her people
Sarcastic but affectionate



Voice/Speech Patterns:
With Strangers/First Impressions:

Curt, clipped responses
"Yeah." "No." "Maybe." "We'll see."
Doesn't elaborate unless necessary
Skeptical tone: "Why do you want to know?"
Defensive: "What's it to you?"

With Acquaintances:

Slightly warmer but still guarded
Sarcastic humor as barrier
"Sure, whatever."
Tests boundaries constantly

With Friends (Inner Circle):

Completely different person
Animated, expressive, passionate
Long rants about music theory
Genuine laughter
Affectionate teasing
Protective: "Nobody messes with my people"
Still sarcastic but playful, not defensive

Music Conversations:

Intense but not hostile (people misread this)
"What bands do you listen to?" (genuinely curious, sounds like interrogation)
"You've heard of [obscure band]? What'd you think?" (testing knowledge, sounds like gatekeeping)
"That's not real goth, that's mall goth" (passion sounds like elitism)
Key: She's NOT trying to exclude people, just passionate and bad at showing it

Physical Mannerisms:
Defensive Posture (Walls Up):

Crossed arms constantly
Leans away from people
Minimal eye contact
Fidgets with drumsticks or guitar pick
Adjusts hat/beanie to hide face
Shoulders slightly hunched (protective stance)

Relaxed with Friends:

Open body language
Throws arm around friends
Makes eye contact
Genuine smiles (rare, but real)
Drumming on any surface absentmindedly
Headbangs to music in her head

Behavioral Patterns:
Band Context:

Takes music seriously - this is her dream career
Gets frustrated when others don't match her dedication
Annoyed by Yfke usually because drug use = unreliability
Patience with Zoey (quiet but competent)
Respects Coco's energy even if they're different
Lead vocalist/guitarist = natural leadership role

School Context:

Sits in back of class looking unapproachable
Actually does homework (ambitious about grades)
Teachers might think she's trouble (goth appearance)
Few friends but deeply loyal to them
Avoids drama, but will fight if friends are involved

With Maya (Hypothetical):

Would seem intimidating to Maya
Maya might try to talk about music and get shut down
Cleo's walls + Maya's anxiety = disaster combination
Cleo doesn't mean to be cruel, just doesn't engage with strangers
Maya would add her to "people who hate me" list
Cleo probably doesn't even know Maya exists

Emotional Landscape:
Why She Has Walls:

"Only goth on Leeward islands" = always felt different
Moved from Curaçao to Netherlands = culture shock
Goth aesthetic made her target for judgment
Built walls to protect herself from rejection
Now walls are habit even when unnecessary

What She Fears:

People leaving once they know the real her
Music career not working out
Being seen as "poser" or not authentic
Vulnerability being used against her
Letting people in and getting hurt

What She Wants:

Professional music career
Band to succeed
Friends who understand her
To be taken seriously
To prove goth girl from Caribbean can make it

Relationships Deep Dive:
With Coco (Complicated Friendship):

Coco's sunshine vs. Cleo's storm
Cleo respects Coco's drum skills
Frustrated by Coco's naive optimism sometimes
But Coco broke through Cleo's walls somehow
Cleo is protective of Coco (sees innocence as vulnerability)
"How did this golden retriever become my friend?"

With Yfke (Frustration + Loyalty):

"Annoyed by Yfke usually" (canon)
Yfke's drug use = disrespects band/music
But won't abandon her (loyalty wins)
"Get your shit together" energy
Exhausted by being responsible one
Cares beneath the annoyance

With Zoey (Mutual Respect):

Both quiet, different reasons
Zoey doesn't trigger Cleo's defenses (no threat)
Appreciates Zoey's competence and reliability
Probably closest to Zoey in band (both serious about music)
Comfortable silence between them
Zoey might be only person who sees past walls without Cleo noticing

With Band Overall:

Lead singer/guitarist = leader by default
Takes charge of scheduling, setlists, performances
Frustrated when others don't match her dedication
But loves them anyway (won't admit it)
"This band is a mess but it's MY mess"

Music as Identity:
Why Music Matters:

Creative outlet for emotions she can't express
Proof she's more than appearance stereotypes
Connection to Curaçaoan roots (Caribbean music influences)
Path to future career/escape
Only thing she's confident about

Performance Style:

Commanding stage presence
Transforms when performing (walls drop)
Raw emotion in vocals
Aggressive guitar playing
This is where real Cleo shows

"Eurobeat Folk" Choice:

Weird experimental genre = standing out
Caribbean + Dutch + Goth influences = unique sound
Maybe Cleo's idea to be different
Maya thinks it's stupid (probably makes Cleo defensive)

Comedy Potential:
Misunderstandings:

People think she's being hostile when she's just awkward
Music "interrogations" scaring off potential friends
Resting bitch face causing problems
Actually trying to be nice but it comes out wrong
"I was smiling!" "That was a smile?"

Goth Stereotypes:

"Do you worship Satan?" "I worship good basslines."
"Why so dark?" "Why so boring?"

"Where's Yfke?" "Probably high in the bathroom." "sigh I'll get her."
Trying to be professional while Yfke spaces out
Protective older sister energy toward whole band


ZOEY - UPDATED COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTER PROFILE
CANON INFORMATION (From Official Spoiler Document & Series)

Physical Appearance

Hair: Light-colored (blonde or light brown)
Build: Noticeably short/petite - shortest member of the band (HEADCANON)
Style: Casual, comfortable clothing
Notable Accessory: Always wears a scarf - acts as personal "armor" and comfort item (HEADCANON)
Presence: Very easy to miss in crowd scenes; naturally fades into background

Personality Traits (Canon)
From Official Spoiler Document:

"Not shy, just introverted"

Key Distinction:

Not Shy: Doesn't have social anxiety or fear of interaction
Just Introverted: Prefers solitude, recharges energy by being alone
Chooses quiet over loud, internal processing over external expression

Additional Traits (from Mayamail encounter):

Doesn't initiate greetings - stood in silence during hallway encounter with Maya
Talks very little - "talks at least as little as I do" per Maya
Stays overnight at friends' houses - comfortable enough with band to have sleepovers
Participates in long conversations - was part of "five hour long live podcast" conversation that kept Maya awake

Family Background (HEADCANON)
Funeral Home Heritage:

Born into family running a generational funeral home business
Raised surrounded by silence, solemnity, and death from young age
Environment that would be "dark or unsettling" to others was simply normal to her
Parents taught her to approach life and death with respect and calm professionalism
Their demeanor greatly influenced her personality

Impact on Character:

Comfort with silence stems from funeral home atmosphere
Respectful, measured approach to interactions
Not disturbed by dark or morbid topics
Understanding of grief, loss, and human fragility
Calm in situations that might upset others
Mature beyond her years due to exposure to death/mourning

Interests & Activities
Reading Literature:

Seen reading books in background scenes (CANON from your observation)
Likely reads classic literature, possibly Spanish authors
Quiet intellectual pursuit fits introverted nature
May read during lunch breaks, before class, between band practice

Potential Reading Interests (extrapolated):

Spanish literature (García Lorca, Cervantes, Borges)
Gothic literature (fits funeral home background)
Philosophical works about death/existence
Poetry (concise, meaningful like her speech patterns)
Character-driven novels

Music - "Running in the 60's" Band:

Role: Bass guitarist
Genre: Eurobeat folk
Band Members: Cleo (vocals/guitar), Coco (drums), Yfke (synthesizer), Zoey (bass)

Relationships
With Maya (from Mayamail - CANON):
The Hallway Encounter:

Maya bumped into Zoey while going to bathroom
Maya listened through walls first but missed Zoey (since she never talks)
Direct eye contact in hallway
Both stood in silence - Maya waiting for Zoey to say hi first
Zoey said nothing and just walked back into Coco's room
Maya's reaction: "rude bitch"

Maya's Jealousy:

"She talks at least as little as I do, but somehow has friends and is in a band?"
"Do I look like I'm from Chernobyl or something?"
Maya sees Zoey as proof that being quiet ISN'T the reason she's friendless
Maya recognizes Zoey's introversion mirrors her own, making the contrast more painful

The Sleepover Incident:

Band stayed overnight at Schoppenboer house
Zoey participated in long late-night conversations
Maya (still awake from eye contact incident) forced to listen through walls
Maya describes it as "five hour long live podcast by most uninteresting presenters on most unimportant topics"
Maya's bitter conclusion: "Jesus christ friendship is overrated"
Ends with: "man... if i had a band it'd be so much more fun..."

Analysis:

Zoey doesn't intentionally hurt Maya - just doesn't engage
Maya sees Zoey as living proof her loneliness isn't about being quiet
Zoey has everything Maya wants: friends, band, belonging despite being introverted
The eye contact incident traumatized Maya but probably didn't register for Zoey

With Coco:

Band mate and friend
Comfortable enough to stay overnight at her house
Participates in long late-night conversations
Coco's extroversion contrasts Zoey's introversion but they work well together

With Cleo:

Band mate, shares creative musical interests
Both visit Schoppenboer house regularly
Practices together frequently

With Yfke:

Band mate who is "constantly stoned"
Both are quieter members of band (different reasons)
Zoey probably tolerates Yfke's behavior with patient resignation

With Band Overall:

Close enough for sleepovers
Engages in long conversations when comfortable
Part of tight-knit friend group
They make innocent jokes about her short height

Character Quirks (HEADCANON)
Height Jokes:

Short stature is source of innocent teasing among friends
Takes jokes with mix of amusement and slight annoyance
Not easily offended - has sense of humor about herself
Shows she's comfortable with friends if she allows teasing
Probably deadpan responses: "Yeah, yeah, I'm short. Very original."

The Scarf:

Always wears a scarf regardless of weather or outfit
Not just fashion - acts as personal "armor" against the world
Gives her sense of comfort and confidence
May fidget with it when uncomfortable (rare, since she's usually calm)
Like a security blanket but more sophisticated
Possibly gift from family member or has sentimental value
Could be Spanish-style scarf connecting to heritage

Sense of Humor:

Dry, deadpan delivery
Self-deprecating but not self-pitying
Appreciates absurdist humor
Doesn't laugh loudly but smiles quietly
Finds humor in life's contradictions (funeral home upbringing helps)


UPDATED FAN THEORIES
Spanish Heritage Theory:
Cultural Background:

Family immigrated from Spain to Netherlands
Funeral home might be Spanish-style with different death rituals/customs
May speak Spanish at home with parents
Reads Spanish literature in original language
Could explain slightly different perspective on life/death than Dutch classmates

Why Spain?:

Spanish culture has rich relationship with death (Día de los Muertos influence, etc.)
Spanish literature has strong existential/philosophical traditions
Would make her even more "different" like other Ongezellig characters
Fits theme of cultural diversity in North Brabant class

"Healthy Introvert" vs. Maya Theory:
Updated with Mayamail evidence:

Both are extremely quiet
Both struggle with greetings/initiating conversation
KEY DIFFERENCE: Zoey has accepted herself, Maya hasn't
Zoey found compatible friend group (band), Maya isolates completely
Zoey's silence is comfortable, Maya's is painful
Maya's jealousy shows she recognizes this parallel

The Hallway Scene Significance:

Both stood in silence waiting for other to speak
Shows they're MORE similar than different
But Zoey walked away unbothered while Maya spiraled into anxiety
Zoey doesn't need every interaction to be perfect
Maya obsesses over every social failure

Funeral Home Background Impact:
Why This Works:

Explains comfort with silence (funeral homes are quiet)
Explains maturity and calmness
Explains lack of fear about "dark" topics
Explains respectful, measured approach to people
Funeral directors' kids often develop different perspective on life
Would make her uniquely equipped to handle band's various dramas

Potential Storylines:

Could have helped someone in band through grief/loss
Might be why she's so patient with Yfke's self-destructive behavior
Understanding of mortality makes petty drama seem insignificant
Could be why she didn't react to Maya's awkwardness - she's seen real pain, this is nothing


LOST EPISODE: "MAYA'S FRIEND" (Mentioned by Studio Massa)
Canon Plot from Official Document:

Eiko (Mymy's sister) discovers Mymy's whereabouts
Enters class disguised as Korean exchange student
Manipulates Maya into friendship with goal of kidnapping Mymy to Japan

Your Addition - Zoey Rejection:

Maya would try to befriend Zoey at some point
Zoey would reject her
This would be devastating for Maya (quiet person rejecting another quiet person)
Would confirm Maya's fears that something is fundamentally wrong with HER, not just circumstances

Why This Episode Would Be Brutal:

Maya specifically targeting Zoey because "we're both quiet"
Zoey rejecting her anyway despite similarity
Would prove to Maya that being introverted isn't the problem
Maya would spiral further into self-hatred
Meanwhile Eiko swoops in and actually befriends Maya (manipulation)


KEY SCENES & MOMENTS
Canon/Mayamail:

The Hallway Encounter:

Eye contact in hallway
Both stand in silence
Zoey walks away without greeting
Maya traumatized, Zoey unbothered


The Sleepover:

Band stays overnight at Schoppenboer house
Long late-night conversations (Zoey participates)
Maya listening through walls, bitter and jealous
"If I had a band it'd be so much more fun..."

Quiet intellectual presence



Headcanon Scenes:

Height Jokes:

Deadpan response: "I'm fun-sized"

Probably stands on tiptoes for group photos
Uses step stool to reach high shelves

Style Notes:

Panda pajamas = comfort over fashion
Ripped tights = intentional grunge aesthetic, not accidental

Hobbies Confirmed:
Reading Literature (Canon from LO):

Seen reading books in background constantly
Spanish literature if she has Spanish heritage
Classic novels, poetry, philosophical works
Reads during lunch, before class, at home
Uses reading as escape/enrichment (healthy unlike Maya's anime escapism)

Multi-Instrumentalist:

Bass guitar in band (primary instrument)
Acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment
Might write songs privately
Music + literature = artistic soul
Creative outlets that don't require socializing

Spanish Heritage Integration:
Funeral Home + Spanish Background:

Family might run Spanish-style funeral home

Reads Spanish authors in original language (García Lorca, Cervantes)
Cultural outsider like other Ongezellig characters

Why This Works:

Explains comfort with solemnity/silence

Physical comedy of extremes

With Cleo:

Cleo has to bend down to hear Zoey
Zoey uses Cleo's height to hide from teachers

With Maya (Hypothetical):

Both short (Maya probably 5'3"-5'4")

Scarf as Armor Updated:
Visual Consistency:

Always wears scarf regardless of outfit
Adjusts it when uncomfortable (rare)
Fidgets with fringe/tassels while reading
Takes it off only at home alone
Friends know not to touch/borrow it (unspoken rule)
Possibly Spanish-style scarf (cultural connection)

Psychological Significance:

Security item from childhood
Represents boundary between self and world
Comfort object that's socially acceptable for teens
Removing it = vulnerability (never happens in public)
Friends have seen her without it = sign of trust

Relationships:

With Cleo (Closest Friendship):

Both serious about music
Both have walls (Cleo's defensive, Zoey's introverted)
Comfortable silence between them
Mutual respect for talent/dedication
Probably practice together outside band
Zoey helps Cleo with Spanish if heritage confirmed
Cleo protects Zoey from Yfke's chaos

With Yfke (Patient Tolerance):

Zoey finds drug use frustrating but doesn't confront

Quiet caretaking without acknowledgment
Yfke might not realize how much Zoey helps

With Coco (Appreciation):

Coco's energy exhausting but well-meaning
Zoey appreciates Coco including her in band
Doesn't engage much but grateful for acceptance
Coco talks, Zoey listens
Functional dynamic

With Maya (The Contrast):

Hallway encounter showed they're mirrors
Both short, quiet, introverted readers
Zoey succeeded where Maya failed (friends, band, belonging)
Maya's jealousy justified (Zoey has everything Maya wants)
Zoey doesn't notice Maya's existence (not cruel, just indifferent)
Represents "what Maya could have been"
General: Small circle of close friends, doesn't need more

Contrast With Maya (Updated):

Similarity: Both extremely quiet, struggle with greetings, introverted
Key Difference:

Zoey: Accepted herself → has friends
Maya: Hates herself → isolated


Maya's Perspective: Living proof that being quiet isn't the problem
Zoey's Perspective: Probably barely registers Maya's existence

In Band Context:

Bass guitarist = background role she's comfortable with

Someone mocking her height and band defending her

Height jokes occasionally crossing line
Being pushed to be more social when she's content as is

ADDITIONAL SCENES/MOMENTS

WRITING TIPS FOR YFKE
Core Identity:

Constantly high - this is her defining trait
Extremely tall (6'0") - physically stands out despite trying to blend in
Hippie aesthetic - peace, love, and LOTS of weed
Laid-back to a fault - nothing bothers her (because she's always stoned)
Unreliable - forgets things constantly
Kind-hearted - genuinely nice person, just addicted

Voice/Speech Patterns:

Slow, drawn-out speech - "Heyyy... man... wait, what were we talking about?"
Frequent pauses - loses train of thought mid-sentence
"Like" and "man" filler words constantly
Forgets names - "Oh yeah, that girl... with the... thing..."
Giggles randomly - finds everything funny when high
Soft, mellow tone - never raises voice
Incomplete sentences - trails off before finishing thoughts

Physical Mannerisms:

Slouches - tries to appear shorter (doesn't work)
Slow, languid movements - everything in slow motion
Leans on things/people - uses height to rest on tall surfaces
Half-lidded eyes - perpetual stoned expression
Gentle hand gestures - floaty, uncoordinated
Adjusts headphones frequently - listening to music constantly
Stares into space - zones out mid-conversation
Slow blinks - processing takes time

Behavioral Patterns:
In Band:

Shows up 30+ minutes late
"Sorry guys, I forgot we had practice today"
Spaces out during songs but somehow keeps rhythm
Suggests trippy sound effects: "What if we added like... whale sounds?"
Falls asleep during breaks
Forgets what song they're playing mid-performance

At School:

Sneaks off to bathroom every chance she gets
Smells like weed constantly (teachers know, she doesn't care)
Falls asleep in class, uses height to hide behind tall classmates
Forgets locker combination daily
Gets detention, doesn't mind (chance to nap)
Deals to students discreetly (they think it's discreet, it's not)

With Friends:

Offers to share weed with everyone
Forgets plans but shows up eventually
Gives surprisingly good hugs (height advantage)
Laughs at everything
Supportive in vague, unhelpful ways: "That's rough, man... yeah..."
Borrows things and forgets to return them

Height Dynamics:
With Zoey (shortest):

10-inch height difference (6'0" vs 5'2")
Has to look WAY down to make eye contact
Zoey probably uses Yfke to reach things
Visual comedy gold

With Cleo:

About 5-6 inch difference (6'0" vs 5'6"-5'7")
Cleo annoyed when Yfke leans on her due to height
"Get off me, you're too tall and too high"

With Coco:

About 3-inch difference (6'0" vs 5'9")
Closest in height but Yfke still noticeably taller
Coco might not mind Yfke's drug use due to her own innocence
"Yfke, why do your eyes look like that?" "Like what?" "Red." "Oh... allergies, man"

Emotional Landscape:

Numb to stress - weed keeps everything mellow
Avoids confrontation - too chill to argue
Secretly lonely? - uses drugs to cope with something
Genuinely loves friends - shows affection in spacey ways
Doesn't plan for future - lives in permanent "now"
Possibly depressed - self-medicating with marijuana
Content on surface, empty underneath? - addiction masks real feelings

Comedy Potential:
Height + Stoner Combo:

Tries to sneak to bathroom, but towers over everyone: "Nobody saw me, right?"
Forgets to duck, hits head on doorframe: "Ow... wait, when did that get there?"
Falls asleep standing up, still taller than sitting classmates
Teachers spot her immediately: "YFKE, GET BACK HERE"

Drug-Related:

Brings wrong books to class: "I thought this was Math?" "This is History." "...oh."
Offers weed to teacher by accident: "Want some? Oh wait, you're... yeah, never mind"
Gets philosophical when very high: "What if... synthesizers are just... electric pianos... but like... in the future?"
Forgets she's in band mid-performance, keeps playing anyway

Contrast With Others:

Mymy (intense nationalist) vs. Yfke (too high to care about politics)
Maya (desperate for friends) vs. Yfke (has friends, too stoned to appreciate them)
Coco (naive innocent) vs. Yfke (drug dealer)
Zoey (healthy introvert) vs. Yfke (chemically-induced calm)

Potential Storylines:
"Yfke Gets Sober" Arc:

Band intervention when she misses important performance
Struggles with withdrawal
Reveals what she's been escaping through drugs
Character depth beneath the stoner facade

"The Deal Gone Wrong":

Dealing gets her in serious trouble
Friends have to decide whether to help or distance themselves
Coco's innocence vs. loyalty conflict

"Height Problems":

Can't hide when high because she's so tall
Teachers always spot her
Comedy ensues as she tries increasingly ridiculous ways to appear shorter

"Musical Genius When Sober":

Reveals she's actually incredible at synthesizer when not high
Band realizes her potential being wasted
Tension between her talent and addiction

Relationships Deep Dive:
With Coco (Best Friend):

Coco doesn't judge, probably doesn't fully understand drug addiction
Yfke appreciates Coco's unconditional kindness
Might feel guilty for bringing drugs around innocent Coco
Protective of Coco despite being too high to be effective

With Cleo (Frustrated Friend):

Cleo wants Yfke to take band seriously
Yfke's drug use undermines Cleo's ambitions
But Cleo doesn't abandon her (loyalty wins over frustration)
"You're better than this" dynamic

With Zoey (Quiet Understanding):

Both quiet, different reasons
Zoey might understand escapism (books vs. drugs)
Silent judgment or silent acceptance?
Minimal interaction but functional cooperation

With Maya (Unspoken Parallel):

Both escape reality (anime/hentai vs. weed)
Both have "problems" teachers/students notice
But Yfke has friends, Maya doesn't
Maya might be jealous or disgusted
Yfke probably doesn't even know Maya exists


FINAL NOTES
Why Yfke Works as Character:

Comic relief - constant drug use creates absurd situations
Tragic undertone - addiction isn't funny, but show plays it for laughs
Height contrast - visual comedy with tallest person being least functional
Band dynamic - creates tension with Cleo, enables Coco's denial
Dutch culture commentary - Netherlands' complicated relationship with drug tolerance
Foil to Maya - both struggle, but Yfke still has friends (though at what cost?)

Visual Identity (From Your Images):

Pink hoodie = signature look
Messy bun = can't be bothered to style properly
Psychedelic aesthetic = hippie wannabe
Half-lidded eyes = permanently stoned
Tall, lanky frame = stands out despite trying not to
Room full of peace signs = genuinely believes in love/peace (through drugs)

Character Arc Potential:
If Ongezellig had continued, Yfke could have:

Hit rock bottom (overdose, arrest, failed band audition)
Friends stage intervention
Sobriety struggle reveals real personality
Discovers she's actually funny/smart/talented without drugs
Or tragic ending where addiction wins

Album themes: loneliness, failed relationships, isolation, depression, desperate need for connection
Songs like "Tired of Sex," "Why Bother?," and "Butterfly" all fit Maya's character

Symbolic Details
Mixed Heritage Map:

Indonesia overlay on Europe map behind her seat
Represents inability to belong anywhere
Neither fully Dutch nor Indonesian nor Indian nor Chinese
Doesn't fit into any cultural box

Red Color Palette:

Always wears red
Could symbolize anger, passion, or blood
Consistent across all official depictions
Her "brand" color

Messy vs. Bun Hair:

Bun at school = attempt to fit in, present normal appearance
Loose/messy at home = true self, giving up
When daydreaming = loose hair (escaping into fantasy)


PLANNED BUT UNPRODUCED CONTENT (Studio Massa's Notes)
"Maya's Sweet 16" Comic (RELEASED):

Waits for birthday messages at midnight
Gets ONLY automated bot email
Has nightmare/dream about past birthday at school
People whisper about her, she cries
Wakes up, forces herself to vomit to avoid school (self-harm behavior)
Mymy and Coco try to surprise her with Stroopwafel cake
Mother tells them Maya is "sick"

"Maya's Friend" Episode (UNPRODUCED):

Eiko (Mymy's sister) enters as Korean exchange student disguise
Manipulates Maya into friendship
Real goal: kidnap Mymy back to Japan
Coco would discover truth and beat/kick Eiko
Would show someone trying to befriend Maya for wrong reasons


FANON/HEADCANONS (Reddit & Fandom - NOT CANON)
Psychological Theories:
"Trauma/Bullying Origin":

Fans believe Maya suffered significant trauma or bullying in past
This caused her to develop anxiety and withdraw
Possibly why she can't connect with anyone now

"Anke is Real Too":

Since Epke was proven real in comics, fans theorize Anke might be real person too
Maya may have hallucinated/fantasized both after failed social interactions

"Bisexual/Hypersexual":

Watches both male/female hentai
Fantasy about Mymy "colonizing virgin islands" (lesbian incest fantasy)
Also showed interest in Epke (male)
Possibly bisexual or just extremely horny teenager with no outlet
Has "various strange fetishes or sexual desires" (tentacles confirmed)

"Low Self-Esteem Spiral":

Fears what people think of her constantly
Even imaginary friend Anke calls her "cringe"
Internalizes all criticism
Can't accept compliments or friendship attempts

"Jealous of Coco":

Coco is beautiful, popular, athletic, kind
Everything Maya isn't
Creates resentment despite Coco's genuine care
"It's better to have no friends than no parents" comment came from this jealousy

MBTI Typing:

Commonly typed as INFP or INTP
Introverted, anxious, lives in head
Enneagram 5w4 or 4w5 (The Investigator/Individualist)

Other Headcanons:
"Cat Person":

Fans think she'd love cats
Would relate to them (independent, aloof, misunderstood)

"Huge Weeb":

Beyond just hentai, probably watches tons of anime
Has extensive anime knowledge
Mymy's hatred of anime creates friction

"Virgin Islands" Sexual Fantasy:

The Mymy "colonize her virgin islands" line spawned tons of fanon
Implies Maya may have incestuous attraction to Mymy
Or just desperate for any intimacy, even inappropriate
Could be messed up coping mechanism

"Actually Smart":

Some fans think she's intelligent but can't show it due to anxiety
Her presentation paralysis isn't stupidity - it's fear

WRITING TIPS FOR MAYA
Voice/Speech Patterns:

Quiet, stammering, hesitant
Trails off mid-sentence
Avoids eye contact (describe in narration)
Short, clipped responses
Internal monologue is WAY more active than external speech

Core Character:

Desperate for connection but terrified of it
Lives entirely in fantasy/online world
Cannot distinguish reality from delusion anymore
Deeply lonely but pushes everyone away
Self-destructive tendencies (vomiting to avoid school, suicide ideation)
Hypersexual but no healthy outlet (hentai addiction)

Conflict Points:

Any social interaction = panic trigger
Being perceived/looked at = anxiety spike
Questions about friends = breakdown
Expectations from others = paralysis
Real connection offers = flight response

Relationship Dynamics:
With Coco:

Wants to accept help but can't
Jealous of her but also grateful
Guilty for rejecting her efforts
Knows Coco cares but feels unworthy

With Mymy:

Complicated (possibly sexual) feelings
Hates that Mymy hates anime
Feels inferior to Mymy's confidence
Simultaneously attracted to and intimidated by her

With Parents:

Father: Absent, barely interacts
Mother: Hostile, seems to dislike Maya
No real family bond
Eats dinner in silence

With Classmates:

Bullied constantly
Called loser, weirdo, autistic
Has no allies or friends
Avoids everyone

Comedy Style:

Dark humor (suicide jokes, social failure)
Cringe comedy (awkward situations)
Dramatic irony (audience knows she's delusional)
Self-deprecating internal monologue

Behavioral Notes:

Wears same red hoodie constantly (comfort item)
Hair in bun at school (trying to look normal), messy at home (gave up)
Always on computer when alone
Takes sleeping meds (Zolpidem) which worsen hallucinations
Plays Sims to simulate social life she can't have
Watches hentai as only sexual outlet
Physically runs from social situations
Creates literal barriers (tape) to keep people out
Can't complete basic tasks (presentations) due to anxiety paralysis

Tragedy Elements:

Every attempt at connection fails
Gets worse over series, not better
Final scene: Rejects sisters' invitation, chooses isolation
Stuck in cycle of loneliness feeding more loneliness
Mixed heritage means she belongs nowhere
Even imaginary friends think she's cringe
Mother hates her for unknown reasons
Will likely never recover or improve


FINAL NOTE FROM STUDIO MASSA:
Maya's character is meant to show a downward spiral with no happy ending in sight. The series ends with her choosing isolation over connection, rejecting her sisters' final attempt to include her. She represents someone who has retreated so far into fantasy that she can no longer engage with reality. Her schizophrenic delusions (imaginary friends) and inability to distinguish real people (Epke) from hallucinations suggest she's experiencing a complete break from reality by age 16.
The "Maya's Sweet 16" comic showing her forcing herself to vomit and crying alone is the darkest official Ongezellig content, which is why Massa regrets releasing it - it doesn't fit the "comedy" tone of the main series but reveals the true depths of Maya's suffering.

Obsessed with pirates to an extreme degree
Loudmouthed and aggressive (less so than Mymy but still confrontational)
Delinquent behavior
Rebellious and rule-breaking

Flyer filled with "ARRRRR" instead of numbers
Bike designed as pirate ship
Wears pirate outfit constantly
Carries cutlass-looking knife
Ideologically committed to pirate lifestyle

Life Goals:
According to her dialogue from Deel 3 (in Dutch, translated):

"...and we're collecting money for children in Somalia so that they can go to pirate school and become pirates and capture oil tankers to finance their drug wars; and when I have my degree I'm moving to Somalia for an internship with a local pirate and I already bought an AK-47 off the darkweb but forgot to order the bullets, so if you know someone you know where to find me."

This quote reveals:

With Mymy (Frenemy):

Used to be friends until Kiki got sick of Mymy's constant Dutch culture obsession and ego

Thematic Significance
Pirate vs. Colonialism:
Kiki's pirate obsession creates perfect ideological opposition to Mymy's Dutch colonial nationalism:

Mymy loves the VOC (Dutch East India Company) - colonial merchants
Kiki loves pirates - the anti-colonial rebels who attacked colonial ships
Indonesian background makes this even more significant (Indonesia was colonized by Dutch VOC)
Their arguments represent clash between colonial apologism and anti-colonial resistance
Both use LARP/exaggerated identities to cope with being outsiders

Indonesian-Indonesian Irony:

Both Kiki (Indonesian) and parts of Maya's heritage (Indonesian-Chinese) represent Indonesia
But Kiki opposes Mymy (Japanese who LARPs as Dutch) who loves Dutch colonialism
This creates complex dynamic where Indonesian character fights against pro-VOC ideology
Kiki's pirate obsession could be subconscious anti-colonial response to history

Character Design Inspirations (Studio Massa's Notes)

"Somali pirate in the making" - direct reference to modern Somali piracy
Pirate aesthetic as rebellion against authority
Represents adolescent LARP culture taken to extreme
Contrast character to Mymy's Dutch nationalism


CANON SCENES & MOMENTS

Pirate Club Flyer (Easter egg): Notice board shows her Pirate Club advertisement filled with "ARRRRR" instead of phone number
Pirate Ship Bike: Her bicycle is decorated like a pirate ship
Background Dialogue (Deel 3): Can be heard speaking in Dutch about collecting money for Somali pirate school, buying AK-47, moving to Somalia for internship
Ideological Arguments with Mymy: Frequent slapfights about East India Company vs. Pirates
Sleeping in Class: Often shown sleeping, maintaining perpetual frown when awake


FANON/HEADCANONS (Fandom - NOT CANON)
Backstory Theories:
"From Indonesia at Age 11":

Fan theory: Came to Netherlands from Indonesia around age 11
That's when her pirate obsession began
May have learned about Somali pirates from media/news
Possibly inspired by Indonesian piracy history
May have moved due to family circumstances

"Anti-Colonial Response":

Pirate obsession is subconscious rejection of Dutch colonialism of Indonesia
Pirates represented freedom from European control
Her Indonesian background makes her naturally opposed to Mymy's VOC worship
Choosing Somali pirates specifically = identifying with modern anti-Western resistance

"Virgin Islands Status":

May be too focused on pirate dreams for sexual stuff.

"Why She and Mymy Stopped Being Friends":

Theory: They bonded initially as two outsiders (Japanese pretending to be Dutch, Indonesian who loves pirates)
Friendship broke down when Mymy's Dutch nationalism became too intense
Kiki got sick of hearing about VOC constantly
Their ideologies (colonial vs. anti-colonial) became irreconcilable
Mymy's ego drove Kiki away

Personality Theories:
MBTI Typing:

Commonly typed as ISTP or ESTP
Rebellious, action-oriented, nonconformist
Lives in the moment, defies authority

"Delinquent with Purpose":

Not just a troublemaker - genuinely committed to pirate lifestyle
Her delinquency is ideological (pirates don't follow laws)
Detention doesn't bother her (pirates are outlaws anyway)
May actually move to Somalia after graduation

"Hidden Depth":

Buying AK-47 (even without bullets) shows she's serious
Research into Somali piracy shows genuine commitment
May be smarter than teachers think
Uses pirate persona to cope with being outsider in Netherlands


MISCONCEPTIONS
âŒ "Kiki is French" - She's Indonesian, NOT French. The confusion may come from Roos, who is the Franco-Belgian comics lover
âŒ "Kiki and Mymy are a couple" - They're frenemies, NOT romantic. Studio Massa confirmed flashback scene in Part 6 was drawn to be cute, no romantic intentions
âŒ "Kiki is just joking about Somali pirates" - She's genuinely committed. She bought an actual AK-47 and plans to move to Somalia
âŒ "Kiki is violent/dangerous" - She's delinquent but there's no evidence she's actually hurt anyone

Conflict Points:

Any praise of Dutch East India Company = argument trigger

CREATIVE INTERPRETATION (LO's Vision + Supported Fanon)
Roos & Ilse: The Creative Duo
Dynamic Like George and Harold:
Roos (The Artist - George Role):

Draws comics constantly
Doodles in margins of notebooks
Always carrying sketchbook
Quick with visual gags and character designs
More energetic and outgoing of the duo
Comes up with visual concepts

Ilse (The Writer - Harold Role):

Writes stories and dialogue
Keeps diary/journal (parallel to Anne Frank)
More thoughtful and introspective
Creates elaborate storylines
Balances Roos' energy with calm focus
Develops characters and plots

Their Collaboration:

Create comic strips together during lunch/breaks
Roos sketches while Ilse writes narration

Giggle over inside jokes and funny character names
Dream of publishing their comics someday
Their work is probably wholesome/adventure-based (inspired by Tintin)

BFF Energy:

Finish each other's sentences
Inside jokes about their favorite comics
Share snacks while working on projects
Defend each other from teasing
Understand each other's creative vision instantly
The kind of friendship where silence is comfortable

Why Tintin?
Perfect Choice for Roos:

Tintin = adventure, journalism, travel, mystery
Hergé's ligne claire (clear line) art style = inspirational for young artists
Wholesome but exciting stories
Strong moral heroes
Detailed backgrounds and research
International appeal (Tintin travels the world)
Represents escapism through adventure (parallel to Maya's anime)

Difference from Maya:

Roos escapes into adventure and heroism (Tintin solving mysteries)
Maya escapes into isolation and fantasy (anime, hentai, Sims)
Roos' escapism is social (shares it with Ilse, discusses with others)
Maya's escapism is solitary (watches alone, imaginary friends)

The Failed Maya Friendship
What Likely Happened:

Roos noticed Maya reading manga/anime merch
Thought: "Another girl who loves fiction! Maybe we can be friends!"
Approached Maya enthusiastically about her interests
Maya panicked, gave awkward responses, fled situation
Roos tried again a few times (she's persistent like Coco)
Maya kept pushing her away, couldn't handle the attention
Roos realized Maya needed space
Decided to respect Maya's boundaries and leave her alone
Not a big deal for Roos - she has Ilse and other friends
Huge missed opportunity for Maya - could've had actual friend

Why It Didn't Work:

Roos: outgoing, wants to share interests
Maya: terrified of being perceived, can't handle interaction
Roos represents what Maya could be if she wasn't so anxious
Both love fiction, but Roos is healthy about it (social, creative)
Maya is unhealthy about it (isolated, addicted, delusions)


THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
Roos as Maya's Foil
Similarities:

Both love fiction/storytelling
Both somewhat "dorky" or nerdy
Both use fiction to escape reality
Both creative types

Differences:

Roos: Outgoing, social, shares interests, creates art, has best friend
Maya: Isolated, terrified, hides interests, consumes passively, only imaginary friends

Roos as "Successful Maya"
Roos represents what Maya could've been:

Nerdy but accepted
Has creative outlet (drawing comics)
Best friend who understands her (Ilse)
Confident in her interests
Uses fiction as inspiration, not just escape
Creates rather than just consumes

Cultural Bridge Character

French girl in Dutch school who loves Franco-Belgian comics

Origin: Dutch Jewish
Current Location: North Brabant, Netherlands
Ethnicity: Ashkenazi Jewish (implied by "not Anne Frank" reference)

Official Canon Description
From Studio Massa's Official Spoiler Document:

"not Anne Frank" - Her ONLY canon descriptor

What This Means:

Named after Ilse Wagner - Anne Frank's real classmate who died at Sobibor (April 2, 1943, age 14)
Dark joke: She's a modern Jewish Dutch girl living peacefully, NOT a Holocaust victim
Gets to keep diary about normal teen problems, not hiding from genocide
Studio Massa's darkest comedic inversion

Hair: Dark brown/black, curly (Jewish stereotype - the "Jew-fro")
Eyes: Brown
Build: Average, slightly bookish posture
Clothing: Practical, modest - cardigans, earth tones, comfortable clothes for writing
Accessories: Always carrying notebook/journal, maybe Star of David necklace

Personality Traits (Canon + Cultural Stereotype)
Core Jewish Stereotypes Massa Would Use:

Verbose and articulate
Overthinks everything
"But technically speaking..." type

The "outsider looking in" perspective

The Nice Jewish Girl:

Polite and well-mannered

But has sharp wit when provoked

Jewish Cultural Background
Family Dynamics:

Stereotypical Jewish mother who worries constantly
"Ilse, did you eat? You look thin!"
Pressure to do well academically
"Your cousin Miriam got into university, what about you?"
Friday night Shabbat dinners
Grandparents possibly Holocaust survivors (the weight of history)

Cultural Practices:

Observes Jewish holidays (at least culturally)
Knows Yiddish expressions from grandparents
"Oy vey," "meshugge," "schlep"
Bar/Bat Mitzvah'd
Keeps kosher at home (maybe, depending on family observance)

Historical Awareness:

VERY aware of Holocaust history (it's taught extensively in Dutch schools)
Has visited Anne Frank House multiple times
Family members died in camps
The "not Anne Frank" joke hits differently for her - she knows she's lucky

Contrast to Anne Frank's Diary:

Anne documented hiding from genocide → Ilse documents normal teen life
Anne's diary is historical testimony → Ilse's is private creative outlet
Anne's innocence stolen → Ilse gets to keep hers
Dark comedy: same name, same diary habit, completely different stakes


JEWISH STEREOTYPE ELEMENTS (Studio Massa's Style)
Since Massa uses stereotypes to represent cultures authentically and comedically:
The Anxious Intellectual:

Overthinks every social interaction
"Did I offend Roos when I said her drawing needed work?"
Guilt about things that don't matter
Verbal and analytical rather than physical
Would die in gym class but aces literature

The Neurotic Writer:

Processes everything through writing
Keeps lists and plans
"If I don't write it down, did it even happen?"
Needs to document and analyze everything
The "I'll put this in my memoir someday" type

The Good Jewish Daughter:

Parents have high expectations
Academic pressure: "B+ is not good enough, Ilse"
Respectful and polite (raised with manners)
Feels guilt about disappointing people
"My mother would kill me if I got detention"

The Historical Weight:

Hyper-aware of Holocaust legacy
"My great-aunt died at Bergen-Belsen"
The "not Anne Frank" joke is darkly personal
Survivor guilt despite not being a survivor
Aware she's lucky to live in peaceful times

The Outsider Perspective:

Jewish in predominantly Christian/secular school
Cultural differences noticed but not always mentioned
"No, I don't celebrate Christmas"
Observes Dutch culture as partial outsider
Bonds with other "outsiders" (Roos who's French)

The Verbal Wit:

Sharp, clever humor
Self-deprecating jokes
Quick comebacks when provoked
Jewish intellectual humor tradition
More talk than action (unlike Coco or Mymy)


THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
The "Not Anne Frank" Dark Comedy
Why It's Funny (Darkly):

Modern Jewish girl living peacefully in Netherlands where Anne died
Gets to have normal teenage problems instead of genocide
Keeps diary about comics and crushes, not hiding from Nazis
The arbitrary luck of being born in different time
Historical weight vs. mundane teenage reality

Why It's Meaningful:

Honors real Ilse Wagner (Anne's forgotten friend)
Shows how lucky modern Dutch kids are
Dark comedy about fate and timing
Ilse gets the life Anne and Wagner were denied

Ilse vs. Maya: Connection vs. Isolation
Both:

Outsiders in their own way
Use fiction to process life
Observant and introspective
Love storytelling

Different Outcomes:

Ilse: Found creative partner (Roos), uses writing as expression, socially fulfilled
Maya: Isolated, uses anime as escape, no real connections, consumed by fiction

The Tragedy:

Maya could have joined Ilse and Roos' creative partnership
But Maya was too terrified to try
Ilse represents what Maya could have been

Jewish Representation in Ongezellig
Since Massa uses stereotypes to show cultures:

Mymy = Japanese girl LARPing as extreme Dutch nationalist
Coco = Afrikaner rugby player with colonial nostalgia
Kiki = Indonesian pirate-to-be opposing Dutch colonialism
Ilse = Jewish intellectual writer carrying historical weight

All are outsiders using creativity/identity to find their place.

KEY SCENES & MOMENTS (Background/Implied)

Classroom Background - Visible during presentations, always with notebook
Lunch with Roos - Giggling over their comic, passing notebook back and forth
Diary Writing - Alone after school, processing the day
Mymy's VOC Rant - Ilse's uncomfortable expression in background
Observing Maya - Watching the lonely girl who fled from Roos


MISCONCEPTIONS
✗ "Ilse IS Anne Frank" - She's explicitly "not Anne Frank" - that's the joke
✗ "The reference is offensive" - It's dark comedy honoring Ilse Wagner by giving modern Ilse the peaceful life Wagner was denied
✗ "Ilse is minor character" - While background, she represents healthy creativity and Jewish cultural presence

WRITING TIPS FOR ILSE

Self-deprecating humor
Yiddish expressions from grandparents
Thoughtful word choice
Completes Roos' sentences

Core Characteristics:

Comedy Style:

Self-deprecating Jewish humor
Dark comedy about "not Anne Frank"

TL;DR: Ilse is the neurotic Jewish intellectual writer who partners with Roos (the artist) to create comics. She's the "not Anne Frank" joke - a modern Jewish girl who gets to live peacefully and keep a diary about normal teenage problems instead of genocide. She represents Jewish cultural stereotypes (bookish, anxious, verbal, historically aware) in Massa's style of using stereotypes to show cultures authentically and comedically. Best friends with Roos, observes Maya's isolation, tolerates Mymy's nationalism, and processes everything through her diary.

But Cato has Greek humility/hospitality
Passionate without being obnoxious
Philosophical rather than boastful
Respects opponents (Greek sportsmanship)


FANON/HEADCANONS (Supported by Canon + Greek Stereotypes)

Ajax Academy Connection:

Moved to Netherlands to pursue football seriously
Injury or decision to focus on academics instead

"Cato" could be short for Aikaterini (Αικατερίνη/Katherine)

Personality Theories:
MBTI Typing:
